# Telomere Circular Permutations

This is a command-line tool that generates circular permutations of a given DNA or RNA sequence and highlights known repeats in the output.

## Features
- Accepts a DNA or RNA sequence as input (5' to 3' direction).
- Computes circular permutations of the input sequence.
- Determines the complementary sequence and its reverse (5' to 3' direction).
- Computes circular permutations of the complementary strand.
- Highlights the known repeat in red if found in permutations.
